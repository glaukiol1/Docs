## Setup

Setup development with **Rusted Script** on your computer.

### Shell Enviroment

If you want to play around and see what Rusted Script can do, run the shell like below;

Run [shell.py](https://github.com/Rusted-Script/Rusted-Script/blob/master/src/shell.py) with python3!

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Rusted-Script/Rusted-Script.git
$ cd Rusted-Script
$ cd src
$ python3 shell.py
```

### Rusted Script Interpreter

The current version of the interpreter may have bugs, as it is still in [Pre-Alpha (Version 0.0.3)](https://github.com/Rusted-Script/Rusted-Script/releases/tag/0.0.3)! If you come accross any bugs, dont hesitate to open a issue.

## Linux

We have native binaries for linux, so just run the `/Linux_Installer.sh` file, and it will install the binaries for you. After that, go to the `/binary/linux` folder, and run, `./rusted run home/file.rusted`. The `home/file.rusted` is a demo file, and you should replace it with the ***FULL PATH*** to your .rusted file.

## Windows

In windows, we currently dont have native binaries, so you would need to run the interpreter manually.

```sh
$ cd src # go to the src/ dir in Rusted-Script
$ python3 main.py run C:\Users\test\test.rusted # make sure to replace it with your rusted file path
```
